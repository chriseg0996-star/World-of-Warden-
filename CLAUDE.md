# World of Warden — Project Context

## What this is
A 2D dark-fantasy action-RPG, forked from Wardenfall as a fresh project to evolve
independently. Lone hero, cursed-kingdom theme. The entire game lives in a
single file: `index.html`. Roadmap history below up to and including Phase AJ is
inherited from Wardenfall; new work continues from here.

## Stack (hard constraints — do not violate)
- Vanilla JS only. No frameworks, no libraries, no build step, no dependencies.
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering. Web Audio API for sound.
- Pixel-art style. Mobile-first (touch joystick + buttons must keep working).
- **Output is always a single, complete, working `index.html`.** Never split into
  multiple shipped files, never hand me a diff or a partial — edit the real file in place.
- Preserve every existing system when adding features. Do not regress combat, loot,
  HUD, minimap, BSP generation, floor progression, or touch controls.

## How I want you to work
- Senior game-systems engineer. Assume advanced knowledge. Be concise, no filler.
- Prefer one recommended path over a menu of options, unless tradeoffs genuinely matter.
- Implement ONE roadmap phase per instruction. Do not jump ahead or invent scope.
- After each change: confirm it runs, list what changed, and state the next action.
- Format substantial plans as: Phase -> Goal -> Deliverable -> Next Action.
- Challenge weak assumptions rather than agreeing by default.

## Engineering priorities (in order)
1. Performance  2. Simplicity  3. Scalability  4. Maintainability

## Architecture notes
- Logical modules are marked with `// ── MODULE: X ──` comments inside the single file.
  Current modules: RNG (seeded mulberry32), BSP, DUNGEON, FLOOR PROGRESSION.
- Run-level state lives in the `GameState` namespace (floorNum, runSeed, transitioning).
- Grid is 40x30 tiles, TILE=32. Tile types in `T` enum.
- Floors are reproducible: seeded from `GameState.runSeed ^ floorNum`.
- Enemy scaling: `floorStatMul()` geometric on HP/ATK, `floorRewardBonus()` additive
  on XP/gold; stacks with the per-player-level multiplier.

## Roadmap status
- DONE — Phases 1-3 and A-O: full game through render-perf pass (see git log).
- ACTIVE — RPG pivot: spec at docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-12-wardenfall-rpg-pivot-design.md,
  phase index at docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-12-rpg-pivot-master.md.
- DONE — RPG Phase P: derived stat model (classBase + gearStats) + CLASS_DEFS (knight/ranger/mage).
- DONE — RPG Phase Q: gear system core (generateItem, equip/stash, gear screen, loot cards).
- DONE — RPG Phase R: SKILLS kits (knight/ranger/mage), class sprites+portraits, account save, title/char-select.
- DONE — RPG Phase S: chapter/stage select (4×5), stage seeds, stars, results screen, touch pause.
- DONE — RPG Phase T: bosses & endgame (Grave Monarch ch3 + Grave Lurch, The Warden ch4 w/ 3-phase AI + Shadow Lances + wraith summon + Crown drop, victory overlay, Nightmare difficulty + rage timer).
- DONE — RPG Phase U: procedural music (MODULE: MUSIC, 5 synthesized tracks — cursed_keep/bone_crypt/infernal_depths/black_bastion/boss, 800ms crossfade, musicMasterGain child of masterGain, music slider + mute in settings, persists in wardenfall.audio.v1).
- DONE — RPG Phase V: balance pass (ENEMY_HP/ATK_SCALE_BY_LEVEL tables replace 1.22^f blowup, lvMul slope 0.40→0.18, mitigateDmg %-based DR replaces flat atk-def, boss base stats sim-tuned to hit 50/45/35/25% clear-rate windows, Nightmare softened to ×1.35 hp/×1.15 atk, XP curve tiered ×1.6/×1.45@L10, +22%/rl reward bonus, window.__simBalance() + __simBossClearRates() dev harness).
- DONE — RPG Phase W: v1.0 release (README rewritten for current shipped state, canvas contextlost/restored recovery, window.__verifySeeds() determinism guard, Open Graph + Twitter card meta + inline SVG favicon, full preview probe pass — tagged as v1.0).
- DONE — Phase X: title screen overhaul (procedural animated backdrop — castle gate + sconces + hooded hero silhouette + lantern flicker + drifting embers + twinkling stars; menu list with Continue/New Hero/Settings/Credits; v1.0 stamp + foot link; gradient vignette so scene shows through; HUD hidden via body.title-screen class; combined Credits + How to Play overlay; cursed_keep music starts on first user gesture and flows through to chapter map).
- DONE — Phase Y: character select overhaul (body.title-screen → body.menu-screen generalized across all menus; title backdrop now persists through charselect so atmosphere doesn't drop; per-class accent colors on cards — Knight blue / Ranger green / Mage purple — drives border, glow, level color, icon tint; Back button top-left returns to title via backToTitle(); cleaner footer with key chips; gradient vignette on charselect bg lets scene show through).
- DONE — Phase Z: chapter map overhaul (replaced 20-row spreadsheet with per-chapter cards holding a 5-tile horizontal grid; biome-tinted left border + name color — Keep gold / Crypt cyan / Depths red / Bastion purple; boss tiles get red gradient + ☠ corner icon and red hover glow; completed tiles get gold inset; locked tiles dim + grayscale + 🔒; settings gear shrunk 44px → 32px matching menu surface; header split-row layout with X/5 CLEARED meta; gradient vignette so title backdrop shows through).
- DONE — Phase AA: settings/pause overlay overhaul (gradient vignette + gradient panel + ember-gold 18px title matching wordmark; themed slider with gold thumb + glow; themed checkbox with brown→gold gradient + ✓ glyph + glow; _detectActivePreset() compares bindings to KEYBIND_PRESETS and renderSettings adds .active class to the matching preset with gold gradient + ● suffix; all buttons share the title-menu vocabulary — gradient bg + purple border + hover lift).
- DONE — Phase AB: drop WoW reference + settings optimization (KEYBIND_PRESETS.wow → .alt internally; label "WoW (QER+F)" → "ALT (QER+F)"; README + code comments updated; .preset-summary chip row below preset buttons shows live Move/Attack/Potion/Skills bindings for the active scheme so player sees what each preset does without expanding Customize Keys; _prettyKey() shared helper; panel + section margins tightened; redundant subtitle copy removed).
- DONE — Phase AC: in-game HUD overhaul (right-stack #spell-btns + attack-btn + potion-btn hidden on desktop via @media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine); bottom hotbar moved to bottom-center, slots 34→44 px with gradient panel + gold key chips + darker cooldown veil; #stats-panel gets gradient bg, class portrait via hud-portrait img, hero name reads live class def, bars grow 7→10 px with inset glow per channel; mobile keeps the full touch stack).
- DONE — Phase AD: abandon-stage from pause (settings #settings-actions row renders a red "⌫ ABANDON STAGE" button only when gameRunning && !dead && !transitioning; quitToMap() syncs account, closes settings, applyCharacter fullHeal, opens chaptermap; stage not marked cleared, XP/gear retained; collapses via :empty in menu states).
- DONE — Phase AE: gear/death/results overlay overhaul (all three switch from flat panels to gradient+vignette matching menu vocabulary; gear screen gets per-rarity border+glow via .rar-{rarity} classes on equipped slots and stash cards, equip/sell/close buttons themed; death overlay leans red-tinted with dramatic 24px header + red glow + red-primary button; results overlay leans gold-tinted with 36px animated stars + per-rarity loot chips + gold-amber primary button; renderGearScreen and results loot chips drop inline border-color styles in favor of rar-{rarity} CSS classes).
- DONE — Phase AF: hotbar visibility fix (#hud was top:0;width:100% with no height — height:0 → bottom-center hotbar rendered at y=-68 off-screen; fixed by switching to inset:0 so HUD spans the full viewport and bottom-anchored panels resolve correctly; updateHotbar inline font-size:15px → .hb-icon class @ 24px so the 44px Phase AC slots actually show big legible skill icons).
- ACTIVE — MapleStory-style pivot (replace stage-gated chapter map with persistent connected zones, mob respawn, HP/MP persistence across zones; stars repurposed as achievements). AG.1 shipped: zoneTransition() fade-load replaces STAGE CLEAR overlay between non-Warden zones, HP/MP/potions/RunStats persist via opts.zoneTransition in launchStage, walking back through a chapter unlocked via baseline visited-star recording. AG.2 shipped: ZONE_RESPAWN_MS = 45000; non-boss zones repopulate after all mobs dead + 45s via dungeon.respawnTimer ticked in update(), respawnZoneMobs() calls populateFloor({skipBoss:true, respawn:true}) with 6-tile Manhattan distance guard from player. AG.3 next: bidirectional portals at zone edges + world-map fast travel.
- DONE — Phase AH: title screen MapleStory+WoW overhaul (centered menu list → left-pinned character card with portrait + Lv pill + name + class chip + COMBAT POWER value + realm pill + golden ENTER WORLD button, right-pinned HEROES list with all 3 classes showing Lv·CP and per-class accent on icon, bottom-left corner stack with Settings/Credits/New Hero, bottom-right with mute toggle + version+repo, all wrapped in .ornate-frame gold trim with 4 corner sigil diamonds per frame; computeCombatPower(cid) helper sums base + gear weighted; _titleSelectHero(cid) flips account.lastPlayed without leaving the title; mute toggle persists via saveAudio).
- DONE — Phase AI: character select MapleStory class-cards overhaul (small triple cards → 3 tall 220×450 vertical preview cards each with HUGE name + italic tagline + 120px portrait + category badge "Warrior/Hunter/Sorcerer" + Master-of summary + lore paragraph + 4-stat footer LEVEL·STAT·CP·GEAR; CLASS_DEFS expanded with category/tagline/summary/description/statLabel; per-class radial card-tint glow via --card-tint CSS var; per-class accent on name shadow, hover border, footer values; CP reuses Phase AH computeCombatPower so title-card and char-select show matching numbers).
- ACTIVE — Side-scroll pivot: vertical slice behind GAME_MODE (spec/plan docs/superpowers/.../2026-06-12-sidescroll-*). Feel-gate pending user sign-off.
- DONE — Phase AJ: WoW-style class resources (MODULE: RESOURCES). Knight=Rage (built from dealing/taking damage via RunStats deltas, decays out of combat), Ranger=Energy + combo points (banked by bow auto-attacks, spent by Power Shot finisher +25%/point), Mage=Mana w/ vanilla five-second rule; global cooldown (1.5s; 1.0s ranger); ability ranks R1-R6 (every 4 levels, tooltip + level-up toast, balance-neutral); HUD secondary bar relabels/recolors per class + ranger combo pips. Ported from World of Claudecraft's Classic-WoW combat fidelity.

## Project origin
Forked from Wardenfall (chriseg0996-star/Wardenfall) at Phase AJ. This is "World of
Warden" — a standalone continuation. See git log for full Wardenfall history.

## First instruction to expect
"Read index.html and this file, then implement the next phase."
